### JavaScript Code can be used in Two Ways:

1. You can either include the JavaScript code internally within your HTML document itself, either in body or in head. eg: A.Intro.html
2. You can keep the JavaScript code in a separate external file and then point to that file from your HTML document. eg: B.Intro.html and C.Intro.js
